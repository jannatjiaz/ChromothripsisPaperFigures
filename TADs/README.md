get_TAD_boundaries.py - use cooltools to identify where contact frequency changes
plot_TAD_sizes.py - boxplot for average TAD boundaries on chromothrtipic and wild-type chromosomes across a variety of resolutions 
cooltools_visualisation_example_regions.py - plot hic martic with SV breakpoints and TAD boundary calls
